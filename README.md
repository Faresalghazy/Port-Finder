Simple, minimalistic, and open source app to help find an open port on the device.
The app is not intended for security breaching purposes, but rather was made to aid those interested in IoT and servers.
The app works by creating a simple server socket on your phone, then displaying what port it is listening to, and finally closing the 
socket. Full source code is available under GNU license found under my github: https://github.com/Faresalghazy/PortFinder
